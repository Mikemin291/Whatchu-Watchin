I've spent a while working on this project silently, trying to expand my digital possibilities, by creating a chrome extension.

This isn't the first time I've created an essential tool, I actually develop a lot of them. Some of my other websites that you can check out are:
- [avggpa.github.io](https://avggpa.github.io/) for calculating your approximate GPA
- [fontrandomizer.github.io](https://fontrandomizer.github.io/) for all your creativity block needs
- [https://stakeholder-powergrid.github.io/](https://stakeholder-powergrid.github.io/) for accurately displaying the % of power different groups hold in an important topic of yours

Unfortunately, I don't want to spend any money yet on my projects, which is why I am unable to catalog this extension on the Chrome webstore, however if people reach out asking where they can donate to help advance my portfolio, I'll post a link, so that I can make this project more accessible.

Thank you for reading, now here's a quick tutorial for the tool:
1. Download the folder above
2. While in developer mode, load the unpacked folder into your extensions dashboard
3. Pin it on your toolbar
4. Add any show or movie you want
5. Click "Edit Progress" to change the season/episode, or the timestamp you left off at for a movie
6. Click "Remove" once done watching, to declutter or to save space

THIS WHOLE PROJECT IS COMPLETELY OPEN SOURCE, AND ALL DATA IS LOCALLY STORED
YOU CAN TRUST I DIDN'T PUT A VIRUS IN THIS BECAUSE I AM TOO LAZY AND IMPATIENT TO SPEND MORE THAN 10 MINUTES FIGURING OUT WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BUTTONS TO EVEN ATTEMPT AT WRITING A PIECE OF MALWARE
